This bug occurs when using the Expo `Camera` API with a custom `onBarCodeScanned` function.  The barcode data is sometimes not passed correctly to the callback function, resulting in an empty object or undefined value being returned. This is intermittent and hard to reproduce consistently, appearing only after specific camera operations or after the app has been running for an extended period.
